# Glossary of Terms:

Here is a glossary of terminology that will be used throughout the documents on this repository. 

```
           Bit:         A single unit of digital data; values can be either a 0, or a 1.
          Byte:         8 bits of data.
          Word:         16 bits, or 2 bytes, of data.
         Dword:         32 bits, or 2 words, or 4 bytes, of data.
         QWord:         64 bits, or 4 words, or 8 bytes, of data.
Data alignment:         Padding out a piece of data with unused, or empty, bytes, so it will be
                        a particular length.  Word-aligned means padding the data out to 16 bits,
                        Dword-aligned means padding the data out to 32 bits, and so on.
