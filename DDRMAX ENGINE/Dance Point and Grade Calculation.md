# Dance Point and Grade Calculation
## Dance Point Calculations:
During a song, the game keeps track of how many steps of each judgment quality (Perfect, Great, Good, Boo, Miss, O.K, etc) you get.

```
Earned DP =
  (perfect count * perfect multiplier)
+ (great count * great multiplier)
+ (good count * good multiplier) 
+ (boo count * boo multiplier)
+ (miss count * miss multiplier)
+ (O.K count * O.K multiplier)
```
