 # Stepdata
 # Playstation2 Specific Information

In Playstation2 mixes, the game's stepdata is stored in one giant chunk.

At the very beginning of this chunk is an array of offsets, relative to the start of the data chunk.  
Each value is 4 bytes long, and there is one offset for each song in the game.  For example, in
DDRMAX2 -DanceDanceRevolution 7thMIX-, there are 74 songs, therefore the array of offsets is 296 bytes long.
