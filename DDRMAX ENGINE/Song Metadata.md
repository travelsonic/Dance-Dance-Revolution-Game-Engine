# Song Metadata:
Dance Dance Revolution games utilizing the DDRMAX Engine keep specific metadata about each song, which is primarily used on the music selection screen.  This information is kept in the game's executable, and the metadata for each song is stored in a structure called music\_info.  The size of this structure varies from game to game.

## Composition of the music\_info Struct:
**Note:** This information builds upon the work of Aaron in Japan user Taren, who has figured out a great deal of information about this, and other aspects of the DDRMAX era games. [You can see a good deal of his work here.](http://aaronin.jp/boards/viewtopic.php?t=10509&highlight=iso)
