# Memory Addresses

Here is a (currently far from complete) list of memory addresses used in DDRMAX2 -DanceDanceRevolution 7thMIX-.  
To modify these addresses, you will need to use a cheat device, if playing the game on a console, or - if playing
the game in an emulator, need to use either the emulator's cheat support, OR the emulator's debugger if available.

The information here is sorted by function/use.
