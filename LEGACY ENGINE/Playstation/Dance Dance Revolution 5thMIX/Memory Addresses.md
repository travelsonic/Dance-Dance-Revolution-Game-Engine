# **MEMORY ADDRESSES:**
To modify this data, you need to use a cheat device if  you are playing this game on a Playstation.  If you are
if using an emulator, you will need to use a tool that allows you to edit memory while the game is running, whether
it is a separate program like Cheat Engine, or the built in debugger functionality of an emulator.  (No$PSX is a 
great emulator for this).
