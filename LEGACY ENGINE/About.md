# **ABOUT THE ENGINE:**
"Legacy Engine" is an unofficial name given to a game engine used in Konami's 
Dance Dance Revolution series.  The engine's official use started wtih Dance Dance
Revolution, which was released in arcades on November 18th, 1998, and was last
largely utilized in the series with Dance Dance Revolution Extra Mix, which was 
released on June 7th, 2001.  It should be noted, however, that in Europe, Dancing 
Stage Unleashed - which came out in 2003 - saw a simultaneous release on both the 
original Playstation, and the Playstation 2.  The Playatation release uses this
legacy engine, with a 4thMIX based graphical theme.
