# About This Repository:
This repository was created as a central location to store research on Konami's Dance Dance Revolution game enginess, with information coming from my own research, as well as research done by fellow reverse engineering enthusiasts (with all credit given when necessary).

I am extremely maticulous about organizing the data, which will become apparent while browsing the repository.  Hopefully, this will allow people to not only clearly see what has been learned about the game engines, but also be able to use that to both aid further
research, and be able to create unique modifications to these games.

(Erm, AND explain why updates on this are slower than constipated molassas dripping from a beehive .... wait, what?  0 ___ o )
