# About This Repository:
This repository was created as a central location to store research on Konami's
Dance Dance Revolution game enginess, both done on my own, and done with help
from other fellow reverse-engineering enthusiasts.

I am extremely maticulous about organizing the data, which will become apparent while
browsing the repository.  Hopefully, this will allow people to not only clearly see what 
has been learned about the game engines, but also be able to use that to both aid further
research, and be able to create unique modifications to these games.
